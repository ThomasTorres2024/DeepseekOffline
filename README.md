In case there are issues running ollama, make sure the version you have installed is deepseek-r1:7b. If you want to change the model you are running, go to app.js and change it manually there on line 31. I had some issues with ollama that I resolved by closing it, and then opening up a terminal and entering "ollama serve" to start a local server with ollama, it seemed to work well from there
